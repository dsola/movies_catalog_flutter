# My movies catalog
- This is a Flutter application that displays a catalog of movies from https://themoviedb.org. 
- It uses the `BLOC architecture` to connect the API calls with the Flutter widgets.
- I got inspired by different articles published [here](https://medium.com/flutterpub/architecting-your-flutter-project-bd04e144a8f1)
